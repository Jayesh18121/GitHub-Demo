The morning of June 27th was clear and sunny, with the fresh warmth of 
a full-summer day; the flowers were blossoming profusely and the grass was richly green. 
The people of the village began to gather in the square, between the post office and the bank,
 around ten o’clock; in some towns there were so many people that the lottery took two days and
  had to be started on June 20th, but in this village, where there were only about three hundred people, 
  the whole lottery took less than two hours, so it could begin at ten o’clock in the morning and still 
  be through in time to allow the villagers to get home for noon dinner.


  The children assembled first, of course. School was recently over for the summer, and the feeling 
  of liberty sat uneasily on most of them; they tended to gather together quietly for a while before 
  they broke into boisterous play, and their talk was still of the classroom and the teacher, of books
   and reprimands.
